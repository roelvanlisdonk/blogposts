<p>Often I hear people complain about the Microsoft Hyper-V manager, for instance: copying files from the host to virtual machine by using the clipboard is not possible, this is because the Hyper-V manager is not intended to be used like VMWare workstation or player. </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Only use the Hyper-V manager to “manage” virtual machines eg start, stop, copy, clone, add or remove hardware etc.</p>  <p>   <br /><strong>Remote Desktop</strong></p>  <p>When you want to connect to the desktop of the virtual machine, use Remote Desktop.With remote desktop it is possible to copy files from the host to the Hyper-V virtual machine by using CTRL-C and CTRL-V (using the clipboard). In windows 8 the remote desktop experience is really improved, so take a look at it.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>TIP: You can still use free programs like Microsoft Remote Desktop Manager v2.2 to manage multiple rdp connections, but the “metro” windows 8 RDP app is pretty good.</p>
