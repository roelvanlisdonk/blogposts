<p>When you want to open a Microsoft SharePoint 2010 library in Microsoft Windows Explorer you can get the error:</p>  <p>Your client does not support opening this list with Windows Explorer.   <br />    <br />This was due to installing a very old version of the SourceGear Client v3.1.9.    <br />I solved this issue by using the same trick as with the IE 8 tab hang issue <a title="http://www.roelvanlisdonk.nl/?p=871" href="http://www.roelvanlisdonk.nl/?p=871">http://www.roelvanlisdonk.nl/?p=871</a></p>
