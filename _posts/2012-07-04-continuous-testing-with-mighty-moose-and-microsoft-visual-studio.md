<p>A colleague pointed me to Mighty Moose. Itâ€™s a FREE plugin for Microsoft Visual Studio and it can be used for continuous testing. CTRL+S, not only saves your code, but also builds and runs al unit tests that were impacted by the code change.</p>  <p><a href="http://codebetter.com/gregyoung/2012/06/23/mighty-moose-free/">http://codebetter.com/gregyoung/2012/06/23/mighty-moose-free/</a></p>  <p>This is really very nice!</p>
