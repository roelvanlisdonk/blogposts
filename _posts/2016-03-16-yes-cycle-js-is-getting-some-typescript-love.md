<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In his blog post: <a title="http://staltz.com/all-js-libraries-should-be-authored-in-typescript.html" href="http://staltz.com/all-js-libraries-should-be-authored-in-typescript.html">http://staltz.com/all-js-libraries-should-be-authored-in-typescript.html</a> mentions:</p> <p>I am a JavaScript programmer, and I make some libraries. Recently, however, I’ve been writing <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> for <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS">RxJS version 5</a> (used in <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a> which is also authored in TypeScript), </p> <p><strong>and I’m in the process of rewriting </strong><a href="http://cycle.js.org/"><strong>Cycle.js</strong></a><strong> in TypeScript.</strong></p> <p>I find the cycle.js framework very interesting and I love to see it written in TypeScript, so kudo’s for André Staltz, when he accomplishes this.</p>
