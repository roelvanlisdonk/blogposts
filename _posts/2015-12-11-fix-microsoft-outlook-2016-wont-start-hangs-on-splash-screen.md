<p>Today I noticed Micrososft Outlook 2016 would not start and only showed the splashscreen.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Starting Microsoft Outlook 2016 in safe mode fixed my problem.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Just go to the start screen and CTRL + click on the Outlook 2016 icon, it should present you a question, “if you want to start outlook in safe mode”.</p>
