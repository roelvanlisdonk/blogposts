<p>&#160;</p>  <p>Just a good tip from Rob Eisenberg:   <br />Write your JavaScript code in vanilla (standard) JavaScript as much as possible, even your framework code, because the web standards will be there, when your pick of the day framework will be long gone.    <br />Your code base will be much more long lived and you will have less trouble, when migrating to a newer version of a framework or a complete other framework.</p>
