<p>I was able to successfully install Microsoft Windows 8 as a guest operating system in VMWare Workstation 8 by following the instructions at: <a href="http://www.sysprobs.com/guide-install-windows-8-on-vmware-workstation-with-vmware-tools">http://www.sysprobs.com/guide-install-windows-8-on-vmware-workstation-with-vmware-tools</a></p>  <p>On previous installations of Windows, I would always format the disk during the installation process. In this case I skipped the formatting and all worked well and I saved some minutes on my installation time, nice!</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>The whole installation process takes less then 10 minutes on a 8 core laptop with 16 GB RAM and SSD.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>PS I used the [customize option] to use a LIVE id for signing in to Windows 8.</p>
