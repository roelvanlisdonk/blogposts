<p>When accessing <a title="https://outlook.office365.com" href="https://outlook.office365.com">https://outlook.office365.com</a> I was getting a error message that I was signed in with an other account and I had to sign out. I think this was caused by the fact, that I have a private “live” e-mail and a work e-mail on “office 365”. But everything worked again, by following the steps at: <a title="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2507767" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2507767">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2507767</a></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Step 4: fixed my problem</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href="http://www.roelvanlisdonk.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image8.png" rel="lightbox"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px 5px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.roelvanlisdonk.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image_thumb8.png" width="580" height="107" /></a></p>
