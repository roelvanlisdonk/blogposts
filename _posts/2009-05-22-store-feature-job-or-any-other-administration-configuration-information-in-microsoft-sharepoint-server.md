<p>There are many way to store configuration information in WSS, but you can use the hierachical object store (SPPersistedObject Class).   <br />This class provides the methods for an object to automatically serialize its state, persist that state in a permanent store, retrieve it at a later time, and deserialize it back into an in-memory object.    <br />It is explained on <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.administration.sppersistedobject.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.administration.sppersistedobject.aspx</a> and here <a href="http://www.bluedoglimited.com/SharePointThoughts/ViewPost.aspx?ID=271">http://www.bluedoglimited.com/SharePointThoughts/ViewPost.aspx?ID=271</a></p>
