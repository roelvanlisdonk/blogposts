<p>After importing a Hyper-V virtual machine from a Windows 10 machine to an other Windows 10 machine, the Hyper-V virtual machine reported a network cable unplugged. This was fixed by running the <strong>netcfg â€“d</strong> command in a cmd on the destination Windows 10 machine and re-creating the virtual switch afterwards. </p>
