From the code editor, right-click anywhere within the class definition, then click Insert Guid Attribute.    <br /><strong>Show All Files</strong>    <br />This command shows the hidden files in all projects displayed in the Solution Explorer when the solution node is selected.

This command can be executed from three different places: solution, solution folders and project nodes respectively.      <br /></font><strong>Copy Class</strong>    <br />This command copies a selected class entire content to the clipboard, renaming the class. This command is normally followed by a Paste Class command, which renames the class to avoid a compilation error.
