I use npm for installing external libraries en tooling so why not type definition files.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Well they are working on just that, kudos to the TypeScript thing.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Non nullable types</strong></p>  <p>An other thing is non nullable types, I certainly want to have that in TypeScript.</p>  <p>It will be possible to tell the compiler, a certain variable is a string and not null or undefined. But you can also write: const x : string | null which means, x is a string or null but not undefined.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Down level async await support</strong> </p>  <p>TypeScript code which uses async await can target ES5</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a title="http://video.ch9.ms/ch9/4ae3/062c336d-9cf0-498f-ae9a-582b87954ae3/B881_mid.mp4" href="http://video.ch9.ms/ch9/4ae3/062c336d-9cf0-498f-ae9a-582b87954ae3/B881_mid.mp4">http://video.ch9.ms/ch9/4ae3/062c336d-9cf0-498f-ae9a-582b87954ae3/B881_mid.mp4</a></p>
