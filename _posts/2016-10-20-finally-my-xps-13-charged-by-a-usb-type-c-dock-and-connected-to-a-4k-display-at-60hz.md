<pre><p><font size="2"><br /></font></p><p><font size="2">From the moment I red about USB Type-C and the possibility to charge and dock my laptop with one cable I was eager to try this. My Dell XPS 13 has a thunderbolt 3 / USB Type-C dock and it is able to charge itself via this port. Dell offers a thunderbolt 3 dock, but there are many troubles with it and it is very expensive and it is not compatible with other systems.</font></p><p><font size="2">So I decided to wait, until a company created a universal USB-C dock that would charge my XPS 13 but also would charge a mac book.</font></p><p><font size="2"><br /></font></p><p><font size="2">It is even rumored that the new mac pro’s will get USB-C charge ports.</font></p><p><font size="2"><br /></font></p><p><font size="2">Just last week I found out that CallDigit offers a USB-C dock, that would charge my XPS 13 and would connect to my Samsung 28 inch 4k monitor at 60hz via a display port 1.2.</font></p><p><font size="2">I live in the Netherlands, so I ordered the dock at: <a title="http://eustore.caldigit.com/screen/product/f0d13a71-4b3d-4675-a958-ad06b752a046" href="http://eustore.caldigit.com/screen/product/f0d13a71-4b3d-4675-a958-ad06b752a046">http://eustore.caldigit.com/screen/product/f0d13a71-4b3d-4675-a958-ad06b752a046</a></font></p><p><font size="2"><br /></font></p><p><font size="2">I ordered the dock on a Monday evening an it was delivered to me on Thursday evening the same week.</font></p><p><font size="2"><br /></font></p><p><font size="2">I connected all my peripherals to the dock:</font></p><ul><li><font size="2">Samsung 28 inch 4k display u28e590</font></li><li><font size="2">external USB 3.0 2TB HDD </font></li><li><font size="2">external slimline DVD writer</font></li><li><font size="2">senheizer headset</font></li><li><font size="2">wired gigabit ethernet</font></li><li><font size="2">Wireless Microsoft ergonomic keyboard and mouse</font></li></ul><p><font size="2"><br /></font></p><p><font size="2">Then I plugged the dock into the power outlet.</font></p><p><font size="2"><br /></font></p><p><font size="2">Then followed the magic:</font></p><p><font size="2">I took the USB-C cable from the the dock en plugged it into my Dell XPS 13. I booted the Dell XPS 13 and……… Yes, the dock powers my laptop and the Samsung monitor worked, but I noticed that the text was a little blurry, nothing extreme, but I noticed it, most of the time, this is caused by the fact that the Samsung monitor is not working at the native resolution (4k) but a lower resolution like quad hd (2560 x 1440) and this was the case.</font></p><p><font size="2">After I received a new firmware update from calldigit, this problem was resolved and now my display works perfectly at 4k and 60hz!!!!!</font></p><p><font size="2"><br /></font></p><p><br /></p></pre>
