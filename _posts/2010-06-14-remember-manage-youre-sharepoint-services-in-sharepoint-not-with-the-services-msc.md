<p>If you have to start or stop a SharePoint service, you should do this, by using the SharePoint Administration page. </p>  <p>SharePoint will copy itâ€™s version of services state to the Services.msc after a predefined time.</p>  <p>It will overwrite the manual changes made, by using the Services.msc.</p>
