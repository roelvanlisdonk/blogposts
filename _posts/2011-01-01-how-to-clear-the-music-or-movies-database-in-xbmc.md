<p>If you want to start from scratch with adding new music or movies to the XBMC meta database, you can remove the <strong>MyMusic7.db</strong> or <strong>MyVideos34.db</strong></p>  <p>In my case I had to remove it from two places</p>  <p><strong>C:\Users\user1\AppData\Roaming\XBMC\userdata\Database</strong></p>  <p>and in </p>  <p><strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\XBMC\portable_data\userdata\Database</strong></p>  <p>This was due to multiple beta installations of XBMC</p>
