<p>When you want to set youâ€™re form as top most form, when it is hidden behind other windows, you can use the Form property TopMost. After setting the property to true, you should set it to false, so other forms can be the topmost form and stop the flashing of the form in the Windows taskbar.</p>  <pre class="code">TopMost = <span style="color: blue">true</span>;
TopMost = <span style="color: blue">false</span>;</pre>
