<p>If you have a large PDF file, like an e-book and this PDF file by using Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Reader Lite, you can use boomarks to remember on which page you stopped reading the PDF file.</p>  <p>Bookmarks can be used, when you install a Javascript file: <a title="http://www.pdfhacks.com/bookmark_page/" href="http://www.pdfhacks.com/bookmark_page/">http://www.pdfhacks.com/bookmark_page/</a> in the folder C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Reader 9.0\Reader\Javascripts</p>
