<p>&#160;</p>  <p>I canâ€™t find setup project templates in the Microsoft Visual Studio 2011 developer preview and Microsoft says the following on the Visual Studio Setup project templates:</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Future versions of Visual Studio will not include the Visual Studio Installer project templates. To preserve existing customer investments in Visual Studio Installer projects, Microsoft will continue to support the Visual Studio Installer projects that shipped with Visual Studio 2010 per the product life-cycle strategy. For more information, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=197493">Expanded Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy for Business &amp; Development Products</a>. </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Is this because Microsoft wants you to distribute your applications by using the Microsoft Marketplace?</p>
