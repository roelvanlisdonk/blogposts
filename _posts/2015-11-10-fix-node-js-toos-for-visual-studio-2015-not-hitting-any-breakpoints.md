<p>When I created an new project with the Node.js tools for Visual Studio 2015, and set a breakpoint in my app, this breakpoint would never be hit.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>The fix, first make sure, not other debug sessions are running, second make sure you have installed the â€œNode.js Tools 1.1 RC3 for Visual Studio 2015&quot;.</p>
