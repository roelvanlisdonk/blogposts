<p>&#160;</p>  <p>Very interesting: <a href="https://gridstylesheets.org/">https://gridstylesheets.org/</a>:</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Soon after the W3C introduced Cascading Style Sheets, Greg Badros, the author of the Cassowary Constraint Solver &amp; recently retired Facebook VP, proposed Constraint CSS (CCSS) as a general solution for CSS layout. Back in '99 Badros demonstrated responsive layouts with CCSS that today's designers still can't reproduce without grinding out piles of JavaScript. For more than a decade, no one seemed to take notice outside of academia until Apple implemented Cassowary &amp; Greg's pioneering concepts in its new AutoLayout engine with the launch of OS X Lion. Despite the evolutionary leap for app developers, web designers have had to settle with float-based &amp; table-based layouts that have remained unimproved to this day.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Some examples:</p>  <p><a title="http://gridstylesheets.org/guides/vfl/" href="http://gridstylesheets.org/guides/vfl/">http://gridstylesheets.org/guides/vfl/</a></p>
