<p>When you use cmd.exe and change directory to lets say: &quot;C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319&quot; and want to loop through all the files in the folder, just press tab to forward loop all files, press shift tab to reverse the loop.</p>  <p>You can also start typing the first part of the filename and then press tab.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>So if you want to find aspnet_regiis.exe, you can type aspnet and the press tab to start looping the files, starting with first file that starts with &quot;aspnet&quot; in this case: Aspnet.config.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Yes, yes, I know this is probably the oldest shortcut in the DOS / Windows book, but I keep on forgetting it <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" alt="Winking smile" src="http://www.roelvanlisdonk.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png" /></p>
