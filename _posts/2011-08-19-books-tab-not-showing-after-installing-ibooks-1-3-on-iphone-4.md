<p>After installing iBooks 1.3 on my iPhone 4, I did not see the Books tab in iTunes. Even after restarting iTunes and my iPhone 4 the Tab would not show.</p>  <p>I e-mailed a PDF to myself and from the e-mail I added the PDF to the iBooks app on my iPhone 4 after restarting my Windows 7 x64 machine I was able to see the books tab in iTunes, donâ€™t know if rebooting the Windows 7 machine would solved the problem without adding the pdf from the e-mail to the iBooks app:</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href="http://www.roelvanlisdonk.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image5.png" rel="lightbox"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 5px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.roelvanlisdonk.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image_thumb5.png" width="167" height="425" /></a></p>
