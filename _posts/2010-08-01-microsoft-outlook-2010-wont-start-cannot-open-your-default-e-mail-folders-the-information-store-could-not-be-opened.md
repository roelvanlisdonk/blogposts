<p>After I installed Microsoft Outlook 2010 on a Windows 7 x64 machine, I screwed up the exchange configuration and after that Microsoft Outlook 2010 starts with the error: Cannot open your default e-mail folders. The information store could not be opened. </p>  <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>  <p>I removed my exchange profile: Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Mail &gt; Show Profilesâ€¦ &gt; Remove the corrupted profile.</p>
