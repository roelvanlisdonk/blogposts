<p>A very great podcast on developer anarchy: <a title="http://www.se-radio.net/2016/03/se-radio-episode-253-fred-george-on-developer-anarchy/" href="http://www.se-radio.net/2016/03/se-radio-episode-253-fred-george-on-developer-anarchy/">http://www.se-radio.net/2016/03/se-radio-episode-253-fred-george-on-developer-anarchy/</a></p> <p>As Fred George explains, developer anarchy will work in environments, where you have C-Level Buy-In and can have rapid feedback.</p> <p>So you better not try it on the mars lander project <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile" src="https://www.roelvanlisdonk.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/wlEmoticon-smile.png">.</p> <p>It envies self-directed teams, fast deployment, rapid feedback, small components / services and business knowledge by the developers.</p>
