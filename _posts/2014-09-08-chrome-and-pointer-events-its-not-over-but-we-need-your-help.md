<p>Kudos to Chris Love:</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a title="http://www.love2dev.com/#!article/Chrome-and-Pointer-Events-Its-Not-Over-but-We-Need-Your-Help" href="http://www.love2dev.com/#!article/Chrome-and-Pointer-Events-Its-Not-Over-but-We-Need-Your-Help">http://www.love2dev.com/#!article/Chrome-and-Pointer-Events-Its-Not-Over-but-We-Need-Your-Help</a></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h4>What Can You Do?</h4>  <p>I got wind the Blink team, that is the team that created Google's Chrome browser, is watching the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=162757">Chromium bug tracker issue #162757</a>. This is the issue/bug report filed to have pointer events added to Chrome. They are trying to gauge how popular the API is with developers. The metric is how many times the issue is starred.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=162757"><img alt="Chromium Pointer Events Bug Issue 162757" src="http://images.professionalaspnet.com/chromium-issue-162575-pointer-events.png" /></a></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>So please take a moment and tap the star in the top-left corner of the page and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=162757">register your vote in support of pointer events in Chrome</a>. Then tell some friends to do the same. Maybe the Blink team will take notice and use the code that was checked into the WebKit source almost 2 years ago and give developers an easy to use input modality abstraction API. In the end developers will have a much easier time dealing with new input modalities and end users can have better user experiences.</p>
