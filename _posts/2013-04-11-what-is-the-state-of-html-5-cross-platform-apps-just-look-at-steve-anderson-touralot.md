<p>Just go to the Apple store on your iPhone and download the Touralot app.</p>  <p>This app is written in HTML 5 CSS3 and uses in PhoneGap to create a Apple store compatible app package.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href="http://blog.stevensanderson.com/category/touralot/">http://blog.stevensanderson.com/category/touralot/</a></p>  <p>The Look and Feel and the performance are just amazing.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>If you are a web oriented company and the business demands an app, your web development team can rapidly, create iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Windows 8 apps to get quick user feedback and when they ran into platform features that are not supported by PhoneGap (at this time) or performance issues, there is still the possibility to write a part of the app in native code or convert the whole app to native by platform specific developers.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Kudos for Steve Anderson for creating this awesome app.&#160; </p>
