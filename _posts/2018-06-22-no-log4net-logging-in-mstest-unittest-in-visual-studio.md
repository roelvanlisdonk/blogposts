<p>
Â </p><p>I was testing a C# method that used log4net for logging, when running the code in the production app the method logged to a log file, but when I executed the method inside a UnitTest I wasn't getting any logging.
</p><p>Turns out, I forgot to call <span style="color:black; font-family:Consolas; font-size:9pt"> XmlConfigurator.Configure(); before calling the method.
</span></p>
