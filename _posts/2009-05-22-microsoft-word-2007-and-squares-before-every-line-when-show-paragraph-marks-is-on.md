<p>When you open a Microsoft Office Word 2007 document and turn on the &quot;Show paragraph marks&quot; (Ctrl + *), you might find squares before every line. This is because the Paragraph - Line and Page Breaks function Keep with next is turned on.   <br />    <br /><strong>You can turn this function off by following the steps:     <br /></strong>Select the text    <br />Right click on the selected text    <br />Click on <strong>Paragraph...     <br /></strong>Click on the tab <strong>Line and Page Breaks     <br /></strong>De-select <strong>Keep with next     <br /></strong>Click on <strong>OK</strong></p>
